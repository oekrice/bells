2nd Dec: Uses old ringing down config and functions. Testing downness with generations. Pop size 250 with initial partial, with fitness increments and alpha = 4.  
Next:
Same with alpha = 2. Took sightly longer to find good solution but did in the end.
Next:
Changed fitness fn to be mean. Found some goo dsolutions but took a long time to do so, and rebounded after about 800 as things got complicated.

Next: Initial graph size zero, minimum fitness, alpha = 4. Only have bell up in evolve.
No significant improvement, reverting to partial initial

Next: Partial graph size, only have bell up.
Seems to have worked just as well. But was more patient. Should test no initial again, but maybe with up only.

Changing fitness function halfway through worked a charm! Bell is definitely as down as is reasonable now
Regard that as solved... Took 120 ish to get to a reasonable solution and then another 40 or so to perfect

Next: Unconnected initially, MEAN stagnation. 
Initial best fitness 0.00078.

Determined MEAN stagation is a bad idea, and it is quicker to start partially connected. Worth a shot...


Best so far:
alpha = 4, minimum.
